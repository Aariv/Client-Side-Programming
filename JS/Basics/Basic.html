	<h1>What Client-Side Javascript CANNOT do?</h1>
	<p>
		Remember that JavaScript is a client-side program that you downloaded from a server, run inside the browser of your(client) machine.

		As a security purpose:

		<li>
			<ol>It cannot read file from client's machine.</ol>
			<ol>It can only connect to the server that it come from. It can read file from the server that it comes from. It cannot write file into the server machine</ol>
			<ol>It cannot connect to another server</ol>
			<ol>It cannot close a window that it does not open</ol>
		</li>
	</p>
