	<h1>1. Introduction </h1>
	<p>
		It began as a Client-side Programming Language run inside a web browser.

		Javascript is most widely used client-side programming language that lets you supercharge your HTML with interactivity, animation and dynamic visual effect for better User Interface and User Experience(UI/UX). 
		<li>
			<ol> a small, lightweight ,object oriented, cross-platform, special purpose scripting language meant to be run under a browser.
			</ol>
			<ol>
				a <i>client side scripting lanuage</i> to enrich web user-interfaces and create dynamic web pages.
			</ol>
			<ol>the engine that supports AJAX (Asynchronous Javascript XML) </ol>
		</li>
		Javascript works together with HTML/CSS. HTML provides the contents (or structure);
		CSS specifies the presentation;
		JavaScript programs the behaviour.

		Together they enrich the UI/UX of the web pages.

	<h1>JavaScript is Now Everywhere with Node.js</h1>

	<p>
		Javascript was originally created as a client side web programming language, running in a web browser, to supercharge HTML. It has grown beyond the client-side programming!
	</p>

	<h1>JavaScript Vs Java</h1>
	<p>
		Java is a <i>full-fledged general purpose language</i> It was created by James Gosling
	</p>
	<h1>What Client-Side Javascript CANNOT do?</h1>
	<p>
		Remember that JavaScript is a client-side program that you downloaded from a server, run inside the browser of your(client) machine.

		As a security purpose:

		<li>
			<ol>It cannot read file from client's machine.</ol>
			<ol>It can only connect to the server that it come from. It can read file from the server that it comes from. It cannot write file into the server machine</ol>
			<ol>It cannot connect to another server</ol>
			<ol>It cannot close a window that it does not open</ol>
		</li>
	</p>
